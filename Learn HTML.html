<center><h1>13. Introduction to HTML</h1></center>
<ol>
	<li>HTML</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Websites are made of HTML, CSS and JS files. A website can't function with CSS or JS files alone.</li>
			<li>But a website can work be made with HTML file alone. </li>
			<li>HTML = <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage</li>
			<li>HyperText = Parts of text that link to other documents</li>
			<li>Markup Language = HTML Tags. People used to mark parts of a text with certain rules to denote which needs to be italicized, bold, etc., similarly HTML is a markup language that uses HTML tags to do the same.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>HTML tags</li>
</ol>
<center><h1>14. Anatomy of HTML Tag</h1></center>
<ol>
	<li>Self closing tags</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Some tags require both start and end tag. But some are <b>self closing</b> meaning they don't require a closing tag</li>
			<li>For example: the <b>&lt;br&gt;</b> tag</li>
		</ul>
	<li>HTML attributes</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Attributes lets us specify some rules about the function or appearance of the tag.</li>
			<li>For example, the <b>&lt;hr&gt;</b> is called a Horizontal rule tag that creates a horizontal line. with the attribute called <b>size</b> we can define the thickness of the horizontal line</li>
			<li><b>&lt;hr size="3"&gt;</b> will make the line 3 pixel thinkness</li>
			<li><b>&lt;hr&gt;</b> is also a Self closing tag</li>
		</ul>
	<li><a href="url">devdocs.io</a></li>
	<li><a href="url">codeopen.io</a></li>
	<li>Commenting in HTML</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Use <b>"&lt;!-- --&gt;"</b> to comment</li>
			<li>For Multiline comment, use the <b>"--&gt;"</b> on a different line and type the text in between them</li>
		</ul>
</ol>
<center><h1>17. The HTML Boilerplate</h1></center>
<ol>
	<li>Doctype</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </b> tells the browser which version of html the file was written in. The latest version is the html5 and the above line denotes html5</li>
		</ul>
	<li>html tag</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Every element in the html file will be inside the <b>&lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</b> tag. Actually the contents go inside the <b>body tag</b> and the body tag is inside the html tag itself</li>
			<li>html tag has an attribute called <b>lang</b> which denotes in which language the text content of the website is written in. For example, <b>&lt;html&gt; lang="en"</b> denotes that the language is in english</li>
			<li>Its not important for those who can see and read the page. But it's important for the people who can't as they rely on some computer narrating tools, which requires to know in which language the content is in for the correct pronounciation</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Head tag</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Important information required for the website is placed inside <b>&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;</b> tag, but its <b>not visible to the user</b>
			<ol>
				<li>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</li>
					<ul>
						<li>For example, it includes the <b>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</b> to denote which charset that the text in the file should use so that the browser can render them correctly. Some character sets may include emojis and some may not. So, it is good practice to always include and use the right charset for the website</li>
					</ul>
				<li>&lt;title&gt;
					<ul>
						<li>The title tag denotes the title of the page. Its the text that gets displayed in the tabs of the browser.</li>
					</ul> 
			</ol> 
			<li>There are other things that can go inside the head tag, its not discussed here</li>
			
		</ul>
	<li>Body tag</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This is where the content of the website goes</li>
		</ul>
</ol>
<center><h1>18. Structuring text in HTML</h1></center>
<ol>
	<li>&lt;P&gt; tag</li>
	<li>&lt;i&gt; tag vs. &lt;em&gt; tag</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The <b>i</b> and <b>em</b> tags both are used to italicize the words. But the <b>em</b> tag not only italicizes but also tells the system narrator to <b>emphasize</b> the word while it being read</li>
		</ul>
	<li>&lt;b&gt; tag vs &lt;strong&gt; tag</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Similar to the <b>i</b> and the <b>em</b> tags, <b>strong</b> and <b>b</b> tags both are used the make the text inside them stand out by bolding them</li>
			<li>But <b>strong</b> is a logical state and <b>b</b> is a physical state.</li>
		</ul>
</ol>
<center><h1>19. HTML lists</h1></center>
<ol>
	<li>Unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;)</li>
	<li>Ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Both these list tags introduces the use of element tag called <b>&lt;li&gt;</b> for each item in the list</li>
	<li>We can customize the list, for eg, using Roman numerals instead of numbers in the ordered lists by using attribute: <b>&lt;ol&gt; type="i"</b></li>
	<li>You can also make the list start at a particular number by using the attribute <b>start="number"</b></li>
</ul>
<center><h1>20. HTML Image elements</h1></center>
<ol>
	<li>&lt;img&gt; tag</li>
		<ul>
			<li>the &lt;img&gt; tag requires an attribute called <b>src</b> which is called as source, which is the locaction of the image that needs to be displayed</li>
			<li>The source can be an online link or a computer directory</li>
			<li>In the case of a computer directory, if the .html file as well as the image are in the same directory, then only file name along with the extension (for eg. src="Wallpaper.png") is enough</li>
			<li>But if they are in different directory, then the full path of the image is to be entered</li>
			<li>Apart from the <b>src</b> attribute, there is another attribute called as <b>alt</b> which stands for <b>alternative text</b> which is used to display a text in case if a browser can't locate or render the image</li>
			<li>the <b>alt</b> tag also helps in search optimization and increases ranking of the website by making it easier for google to fetch relevant information</li>
		</ul>
</ol>
<center><h1>21. HTML Links and Anchor Tags</h1></center>
<ol>
	<li>The &lt;a&gt; (Anchor) tag</li>
		<ul>
			<li> &lt;a&gt; tag is used to include links in the website. It requires an attribute called <b>href</b> which contains the link</li>
			<li>after the <b>href</b> attribute, type in the text that needs to be displayed for that link</li>
			<li>For example: &lt;a href="https://Google.com"&gt;Google's Home Page&lt;/a&gt; will look like this: <a href="
				https://Google.com">Google's Home Page</a></li>
		</ul>
